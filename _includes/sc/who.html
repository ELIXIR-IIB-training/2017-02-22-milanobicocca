  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The course is aimed at graduate students and other researchers.
  <strong>
    You don't need to have any previous knowledge of the tools
    that will be presented at the workshop,
  </strong> 
    though we expect you are familiar with the most common Linux commands 
    (e.g., ls, cd, mv, cp, rm, mkdir) and the main concepts/constructs used in programming (in any language) such as 
    "variables", "loops" and "if conditions".
